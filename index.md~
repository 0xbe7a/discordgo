# Intro
DiscordGo provides an interface to the four known connections to the Discord 
API.  First is the JSON REST API endpoints, second is the Data Websocket, third
is the Voice Websocket, and forth is the UDP RTP connection.  All functions
in the DiscordGo package interact with one of these connections.

# REST vs Websocket vs Combined



# Using the Low-Level REST API.


# Using the Low-Level Websockets API


# Using the Combined High-Level API.
The combined API pairs functions from the Rest API and Websocket
API together to provide an easy way to access Discord.  This layer makes 
some assumptions by trying to provide what it thinks is the best access
method for a given request.
